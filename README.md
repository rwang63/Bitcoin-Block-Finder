An application developed using Python that allows a user to communicate with other peers in the Bitcoin network. 
The program starts without any a priori knowledge of the block hashes (except the origin block) and sends/receives messages to find the hash for the block at a desired height. 
Once that block is found, the data of the block is parsed, and the transaction data is displayed.
